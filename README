Background
This was a small beach project to help Ryan locate the TWA management team members in different cities.
Pat, Peter and I (Zhamak) have hacked a one-page client-side JavaScript/HTML app using google-api-javascript-client library to retrieve the calendar entries (TWA Management Team Whereabouts, Operations Team Calendar) and group them by city.
 
The site is currently hosted on heroku and accessible from here (http://warm-mist-5145.herokuapp.com/index.html).

Google Client
To access Google client api a google client / project has been setup and accessible from the Google API Console (https://code.google.com/apis/console/?pli=1#project:286499572058). If you need to change client api access and details please ask any of the developers to give you access.
