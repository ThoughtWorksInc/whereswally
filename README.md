# Background
This was a small beach project to help [Ryan](https://my.thoughtworks.com/people/rmoffat) locate the TWA management team members in different cities.
[Pat](https://my.thoughtworks.com/people/pbudd), [Peter](https://my.thoughtworks.com/people/plee) and [I] (https://my.thoughtworks.com/people/zdehghan) have hacked a one-page client-side JavaScript/HTML app using `google-api-javascript-client` library to retrieve the calendar entries (`TWA Management Team Whereabouts` and `Operations Team Calendar`) and group them by city.
 
The site is currently hosted on heroku and accessible from [Heroku](http://warm-mist-5145.herokuapp.com/index.html).

# Google Client
To access Google client api a google client / project has been setup and
accessible from the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/?pli=1#project:286499572058). If you need to change client api access and details please ask any of the developers to give you access.
